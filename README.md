# data-model-cassandra

Our startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data we've been collecting on songs and user activity on our new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

As the data engineering team, our task is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. After we create a database for this analysis, we'll be able to test our database by running queries given to us by the analytics team to create the results.
